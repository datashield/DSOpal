Description: Data integration Web application for biobanks by OBiBa. Opal is
    OBiBa's core database application for biobanks. Participant data, once
    collected from any data source, must be integrated and stored in a central
    data repository under a uniform model. Opal is such a central repository.
    It can import, process, validate, query, analyze, report, and export data.
    Opal is typically used in a research center to analyze the data acquired at
    assessment centres. Its ultimate purpose is to achieve seamless
    data-sharing among biobanks.
